a plugin that injects ad block javascript into the cobalt app for ps4.

note if it doesnt load go to settings>app info spam x until you get a dev mode prompt . this will refresh the page.

this is still a WIP. i plan on adding sponsorblock , but i think the main obstacle is the Content Security Policy. this prevents it from connecting to domains other than youtube and google.
